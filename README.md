# Overview:
This repository showcases an exciting exploration into Hand Detection using Jupyter Notebook and the Mediapipe libraries. Leveraging the power of machine learning, this project allows for real-time identification and tracking of hand movements, opening up a range of applications from gesture recognition to human-computer interaction.

# Key Features:
Jupyter Notebook Implementation: The project is developed using Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive and user-friendly environment for code exploration and visualization.

### Mediapipe Libraries: 
The core of the project relies on the Mediapipe libraries, offering a robust framework for computer vision tasks, including hand pose estimation. These libraries simplify the process of extracting key hand landmarks and understanding dynamic hand gestures.
